### UVAPS
A method of scraping the People Search engine at UVa

UVa didn't have a publicly downloadable database, so I made one that everyone at UVa can access instead.

Use data responsibly.

Program takes around 7 hours to run, which could be improved later. 
It's probably better to run this program at night as well, as it puts less strain on the UVa server during peak hours.
